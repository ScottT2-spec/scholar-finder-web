# ScholarFinder Web

A Website I built to help students (especially in Africa) find scholarships, universities, and opportunities to study abroad. I was tired of spending hours searching different websites for scholarship info, so I put everything in one place.

**Website:** [scholarfinder.pythonanywhere.com/](https://scholarfinder.pythonanywhere.com/)

## What's in the database

| What | How many |
|------|----------|
| Scholarships | 485 across 46 countries |
| Universities | 184 |
| Opportunities (internships, research, competitions) | 138 |
| Cities with cost of living data | 51 |
| FAQ answers | 42 |
| Visa guides | 26 countries |
| Test prep guides | 5 (IELTS, TOEFL, SAT, GRE, Duolingo) |
| Essay writing guides | 6 |

## Why I built it

I'm a high school student in Ghana applying to universities abroad. The scholarship search process is frustrating — info is scattered across dozens of websites, deadlines sneak up on you, and a lot of the advice out there is generic or not relevant to African students.

I wanted something that just works: open Telegram, search, get results. No ads, no sign-ups, no paywalls.
